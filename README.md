# Java OOP Homework Assignments

This repository contains solutions to five Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignments completed as part of Object-Oriented Programming course.
Each assignment covers key OOP concepts such as inheritance, interfaces, encapsulation.

## Contents

### Assignment 1: Basic OOP Structures and Algorithms
This assignment introduces core OOP principles, focused on the fundamentals of OOP by building small classes and solving algorithmic problems.. It includes:
- **Rooter Class**: A class that approximates the square root of a number using a custom algorithm.
- **Library Management**: A small system to manage books and authors.
- **City and Road System**: A simulation of interconnected cities and roads, demonstrating relationships between objects.
- **Deck of Cards**: A class representing a deck of cards, including operations like shuffling and sorting.

### Assignment 2: Trees, Banking, and Task Scheduling
This one dives into more advanced topics like managing hierarchical structures and task dependencies:
- **String Tree**: A tree data structure for storing strings and counting occurrences.
- **Bank Accounts**: A system to manage basic and advanced bank accounts, including transaction history.
- **Task Scheduler**: A system to handle dependencies between tasks and order them accordingly.

### Assignment 3: Iterators and JavaFX Applications
This assignment introduces iterators. It includes:
- **Custom Iterators**: Implementation of `TwoArrays` and `Combined` classes, each with unique iterators for navigating over collections.
- **Simple Voting System (JavaFX)**: A JavaFX-based application to simulate a voting system between two singers.
- **Minesweeper Game**: A command-line version of the Minesweeper game with a graphical interface built using JavaFX.

### Assignment 4: Music Store and Graph Theory
This assignment covers OOP inheritance and generic types:
- **Instrument Store**: A system to manage musical instruments (Piano, Guitar) using an abstract `Instrument` class with serial numbers.
- **Equivalence Relations**: A generic class for managing equivalence relations between different types of objects.
- **World Cities Database**: A system to manage countries and cities with population data, demonstrating the use of collections.
- **Maze Solver**: A graph-based approach to solve mazes.

### Assignment 5: Advanced Iterators and Minesweeper
This assignment more on iterators:
- **Custom Iterators**: Further exploration of iterator patterns.
- **Minesweeper**: version of Minesweeper
